# ASK Modulation and Demodulation
This project implements Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation and demodulation in VHDL using the Xilinx ISE 8.1 tool. The project includes both the ASK modulator and demodulator components, along with their respective testbenches for simulation.

# Files Description
- ask_modulator.vhd: VHDL code for the ASK modulator.
- ask_demodulator.vhd: VHDL code for the ASK demodulator.
- ask_modulator_tb.vhd: Testbench for simulating the ASK modulator.
- ask_demodulator_tb.vhd: Testbench for simulating the ASK demodulator.
- README.md: This README file.

# Instructions
- Setup Project: Create a new project in Xilinx ISE and add the VHDL files ask_modulator.vhd and ask_demodulator.vhd to the project.
- Create Testbenches: Add the testbench files ask_modulator_tb.vhd and ask_demodulator_tb.vhd to the project.
- Compile: Compile the design files and the testbenches.
- Simulate: Run the simulation for both the modulator and demodulator testbenches to verify their functionality.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of ASK modulation and demodulation in VHDL. The provided testbenches help verify the correctness of the modulator and demodulator designs. Further modifications and test cases can be added to expand the functionality and test coverage.
